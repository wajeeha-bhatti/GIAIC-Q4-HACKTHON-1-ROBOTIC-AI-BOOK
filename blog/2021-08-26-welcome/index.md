🤖 My Journey into Physical AI and Coding

Assalam u Alaikum! My name is Wajeeha Bhatti.

This blog is not just about my book “Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics”. It’s also the story of my journey through the world of programming — a place where I learned, built, and grew.

🌟 How My Coding Journey Began

I started my programming journey in 2023 with GIAIC, and in 2024, By the end of 2025, I’m still learning from GIAIC academy. Every error, every bug, and every project has made me stronger and more confident.

📚 My Programming Skills

These are the essential skills I learned from both platforms:

Learned from GIAIC:

TypeScript & Next.js: Building modern web applications with strong and scalable architecture.

Python & Agentic AI: Creating Artificial Intelligence and advanced automation agents.


JavaScript & React: Building interactive and user-friendly frontend applications.

HTML & CSS: Understanding the fundamental languages of the web and styling techniques.

💡 My Experience Writing the Book

Writing the book “Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics” was an exciting experience for me. I faced many errors and challenges along the way, but solving each error felt like a new victory. Now, with this book and my new blog, I’m truly excited for what comes next.
