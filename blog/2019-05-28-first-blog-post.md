🌟 My First Step Into the World of AI & Robotics

Writing this first blog feels incredibly special. It marks the beginning of a journey I’ve dreamed about for years — a journey into the world of Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Programming.

For a long time, I wanted a place where I could share what I learn, what I build, and how I grow. Today, that dream finally begins.

🚀 Why I Started This Blog

My curiosity for technology has always pushed me forward. When I wrote my first lines of code, I realized that programming is more than just instructions — it’s a language that allows us to create, solve problems, and bring ideas to life.

This blog is my way of documenting that learning process. Whether I’m working on AI models, experimenting with robotics, or fixing a stubborn bug at 2 AM, I want to bring you along with me.

🤖 What You Can Expect Here

Through this blog, I plan to share:

My learning journey in AI, coding, and robotics

Projects and experiments I’m building

Tips and insights for beginners

The challenges I face — and the victories that follow

Updates from my book "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics"

My goal is not just to teach, but to learn and grow together with anyone who is curious about technology.

💬 A Message From My Heart

Starting something new is always a mix of excitement and fear. But I believe every expert was once a beginner — and today, I proudly take my first step.

If you're reading this, thank you for being a part of the very beginning of my journey. I hope my posts inspire you to explore your own path in technology.

The best is yet to come. 🌸✨
